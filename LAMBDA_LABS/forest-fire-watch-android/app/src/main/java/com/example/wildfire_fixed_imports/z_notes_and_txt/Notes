Things that need doing ASAP:

Testing -- full UNIT TESTING

LONG TERM PRODUCT VISION FOR CANVAS 2



system for handling/replacing/editing fires when they change.
-->SANE FOR AQI
---->NEED A "FILTER CLASS" THAT GATHERS CHANGES AND PROVIDES FINISHED STYLES TO VIEWMODEL, THAT WAY COORDINATOR CAN JUST HANDLE AGREGATING CHANGES
TO BACKEND OBJECTS/ETC
-----> this and a "force map refresh" method are probably the only way we're gonna get the map to maintain complex data through config changes,
high on the list of priorities




NEED ERROR HANDLING FOR HTTP AND PROBABLY OTHER AREAS
-->>mostly done, SuccessFail wrapper and network_controllers infrastrcture supports both handling at the controller level as well as passing errors, throwables
and exceptions up the chain.
----->> SEEMS TO BE WORKING QUITE WELL

FIX BUG THAT CAUSES ICONS TO LOSE COLOR
 -->> likely due to icons being deprecated, https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-plugins-android/tree/master/plugin-annotation
   --> switch to symbols from icons, shouldn't be tremendously hard and symbols appear to offer other options.
   ---->EMULATOR ISSUE, DOESN'T SEEM TO HAPPEN ON HARDWARE


LOW PRIORITY:

/api/users/ RETURNING LIST INSTEAD OF SINGLE OBJECT
   //AS OF 1/142020 incorrectly returns a list of webBEUsers instead of the single altered object,
    //when web fixes the implementation, should be easy enough to simple drop List<> and result[0\
    @PUT("/api/users/")
    suspend fun updateUser(@Header("Authorization") token: String, @Body user: SafeWebUser): List<WebBEUser>
