maps are definitely part of the solutions, flows seem to fit perfectly,

something like -- livedata that map, whenever it gets updated a method is called that reads in the data at the map key,
transforms it as necessary, writes it to the maps style and deletes the original key/value pair

Additonally,
it will make sense to do maps and start implementing some amount of reactive or flow style code
this is likely gonna be a big part of the next release


current model




Activity
 contains fragment

fragment
has ViewModel

ViewModel
creates
MasterController

MasterController
gets data from network controllers

Mastercontroll
passes data to view controllers

view controllers write to mapbox in fragment


alternative:

viewcontrollers passes changes up through mastercontroller to viewmodel which writers changes to
LiveData<Style> observered by fragment.

this is a more MVVM patern I believe and may be worth implementing
