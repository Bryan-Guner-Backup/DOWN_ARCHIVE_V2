The Startup Grant Database (Grantlify) is a location for founders and entrepreneurs to find grants for their startups based on eligibility categories for both the founders and the company. Organizations that give grants can also post their grants online and accept applications through the Grantlify app.

### Key Features

-    Browse and Search for Grants nation-wide
-    Create a Grantee Account and Save Grants
-    Create a Grantor Account and Post Grants
-    Apply for Grants
-    Receive Grant Applications

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React
We chose to use React, React Router, and React Hooks for our application's front-end. These technologies were chosen because of their overall speed and current popularity. 

- React Router 
- React Hooks
- Material UI
- Moment

#### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

#### [Back end](https://startup-grant-database.herokuapp.com/) built using:

#### NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Express, Knex

We chose this tech stack because Node and express provide great boilerplate to get a quality server running quickly. We chose PostgreSQL because we wanted to use RDBMS to be able to establish relationships with our tables and make SQL queries that allow us to join tables and bring the data together easily. 

- NodeJS
- PostgreSQL
- Express
- Knex

# APIs

## Authentication: Firebase

We used Firebase for our authentication. Firebase is easy to use and ubiquitous, allowing us to create an interface that people are familiar with while allowing them to sign in with their Google accounts.

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_KEY
    *  REACT_APP_MESSAGIN_SENDER_ID
    *  REACT_APP_APP_ID
    *  REACT_APP_API=http://localhost:10000

# Content Licenses

none

# Testing

ðŸš«Document what you used for testing and why

# Installation Instructions

    * react
    * react-dom
    * react-multiselect-checkboxes
    * react-router-dom

## Other Scripts

    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
