# APIs

## Firebase

Firebase is a platform to assist in the rapid development of websites that don't need to worry about a backend. It is for this reason we chose to use this API.

# Testing

Cypress was used for testing because it has a unique suite that lets you visualize tests and their results.

# Installation Instructions

Execute `yarn` in the project folder.

## Other Scripts

`yarn run cypress open` opens the Cypress testing suite.
