- Mapbox so we could gain the mapping skills and marker placements that is coupled with the ReactMap-gl.

#### Front end deployed to `Heroku`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/geoseek-be) built using

#### Nodejs

- fast deployment to get product to users.

- Express, Knex, PostgreSQL for DB

# APIs

## Authentication API here

JWT

## Mapping API's

React Map Gl, ArcGis geocoding

## Data Storage

Geoseek-be

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env.local file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL - in the Heroku dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN - in the Mapbox dashboard
