## About this project

Hello! Welcome to City Spires. This is an application that was create to fufill the purpose of helping a new user find an awesome city to move to, without the need for any guesswork. Users can search for cities that they are potentially interested in, see details about the city, and then save to their favorites. Enough about that though, let's talk about some parts of this project you may of not encountered yet with Lambda School.

### For starters:
In Development, we decided to include an awesome third party framework called [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios)!
With the help of Lottie, you can turn JSON into gifs. On their [website](https://lottiefiles.com/) artists will upload short animated gifs, most of which that you can use for free, that can be turned into JSON and displayed in app. How awesome!!

Another piece of helpful code we included in this app can be found inside the Helpers folder. There is a file named ColorsHelper that will, as the title suggests, help you include colors in app! The way it works is by creating an extension on UIColor, we can more easily use color codes straight from their RGB values. There is an awesome website called [Coolers](https://coolors.co/) that will generate a random color pallette for you and from there you can grab your RGB values and very easliy slap them into the app. You're welcome! ðŸ¤“
