#### Advanced Filtering

Advanced filtering is available on GET requests of vendors, products and product-images endpoints. The examples below will mostly refer to the Vendor resource, however, all filtering methods are availible on the Products and ProductImages resources as well. Refer to the [**Data Model**](#data-model-mongoose-schemas) section of this documentation to know which fileds you can filter on a resource.

| Method | Endpoint                                                                                    | Access Control | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/vendors?location.state=PA`                                                                | public         | **Key-Value:** Returns all vedors from Pennsylvania                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| GET    | `/vendors?vendor_category[in]=Spreads`                                                      | public         | **enum fields:** Some fileds in Mongoose Schema objects are 'enumerated', meaning the possible values of the field are predefined.If the field is an 'enum' field, you need to add field[in]=some-pre-defined-value Look at the Data Models to see which fields are 'enum' |
| GET    | `/vendors?location.state=PA&vendor_category[in]=Spreads`                                    | public         | **Chaining:** Use the '&' operator to chain queries together. Returns all vedors from Pennsylvania who sell spreads                                                                                                                                                        |
| GET    | `/vendors?vendor_category[in]=Spreads` <br>`&location.state=PA&select=business_name,avatar` | public         | **Select:** Rather than returning an entire object, 'select' allows you to specify which fields you want returned. This query returns only the business name and avatar of all vendors selling spreads in Pennsylvania                                                     |
| GET    | `/vendors?sort=business_name&select=business_name`                                          | public         | **Sorting:** Return a query that is sorted by using the 'sort' method. By default, sorting is done in ascending (A-Z, 0-9) order. However, if you want to sort descending, simply prepend a '-' (minus sign) to the field--in this example _sort=-business_name_           |
| GET    | `/vendors?select=business_name&limit=5&page=2`                                              | public         | **Pagination:** Queried requests can be returned with a pagination object. You can specify the limit per page and the page number of the results. Retruns the five vendors' business names on page 2 (the 6th-10th result)                                                 |
| GET    | `/products?select=name,price&price[gt]=500`                                                 | public         | **Comparison operators:** **[gt]** (greater than), **[gte]** (greater than or equal to), **[lt]** (less than), **[lte]** (less than or equal to). Returns products with prices greater than 500, selecting only name and price fields                                      |

**NOTE**: For obvious reasons, endpoints with parameters that return only one object, for example, /vendors/:vendorId, do not use some of the query methods above. However, some methods, for example select, can still be helpful. Furthmore, single object responses can use the **populate** and **nest** methods described in the next section.

#### Populate Results

Some resources in the database contain foreign keys of other resources. For example, Products, have a foreign key for the Vendor who created the Product. Product images, have a foreign key of both a Vendor and a Product. Resources related to each other can be populated with information from one another. All children-resources come pre-populated with the ids of their parents, but there is a way through queries to populate a _parent_ resource with an array of all of its children.

Consider the following GET request to the Vendors resource:

`/vendors?populate=products&select=products,email,vendor_category&limit=1`

Adding `populate=products` to the query will return an object, or an array of objects, like this:

```
"vendor_category": [
              "Baked goods",
              "Other"
          ],
          "_id": "5d713a66ec8f2b88b8f830b8",
          "email": "michael@theoffice.com",
          "products": [
              {
                  "diet": [
                      "Vegetarian",
                      "Vegan"
                  ],
                  "unit": "",
                  "_id": "5e14efd2fedc3127c44733aa",
                  "name": "Snickerdoodle Cookies",

                  "category": "Baked Goods",

                  "vendor": "5d713a66ec8f2b88b8f830b8",
                  "createdAt": "2020-01-07T20:53:38.997Z",
                  "__v": 0,
                  "product_image": "5e33c1c8355a2444049fbda6",
                  "id": "5e14efd2fedc3127c44733aa"
              },
              {
                  "diet": [
                      "Vegetarian",
                      "Vegan"
                  ],
                  "unit": "",
                  "_id": "5e14efebfedc3127c44733ab",
                  "name": "Snickerdoodle Cookies",
                  "description": "2 dozen cookies",
                  "category": "Baked Goods",
                  "price": 20,
                  "vendor": "5d713a66ec8f2b88b8f830b8",
                  "createdAt": "2020-01-07T20:54:03.223Z",
                  "__v": 0,
                  "id": "5e14efebfedc3127c44733ab"
              }
          ]
      }
```

#### Populate plus Nest

You can take populate a level deeper with nest. In relationships where there's a grandparent, a parent, and a child, you can nest the children in the parent, and all of the parents--with their children--insdie of the grandparent. The following example is a Vendor, with all of it's Products, in turn the each Product, with all of its ProductImages objects:

`/vendors?populate=products&nest=images&select=products,email,vendor_category&limit=1`

```
"data": [
      {
          "vendor_category": [
              "Baked goods",
              "Other"
          ],
          "_id": "5d713a66ec8f2b88b8f830b8",
          "email": "michael@theoffice.com",
          "products": [
              {
                  "diet": [
                      "Vegetarian",
                      "Vegan"
                  ],
                  "_id": "5e14efd2fedc3127c44733aa",
                  "name": "Snickerdoodle Cookies",

## Image Management

### Cloudinary

We are using a media management platform called Cloudinary:
**https://cloudinary.com/**

The structure of our [**Product Image schema**](#Product-Images) is based on the results.info object recieved upon successfull upload to Cloudinary via the [**upload widget**](#the-upload-widget):

The Market Avenue API only saves _references_ to the images saved on our cloudinary account. Essentially, when you upload an image, you'll need to make two POST requests. The first is with the [**upload widget**](#the-upload-widget), the second is to the Market Avenue API, `/products/:productId/product-images`, with the body of the request being the results.info object from the Cloudinary POST.

There are four main steps to installing and using Cloudinary Image components in the front end React app:

1. Add the Cloudinary cdn inside the head tag in your applications /public/index.html

```
<script src="https://widget.cloudinary.com/v2.0/global/all.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

```

2. `npm install cloudinary-react`

3. `import {Image, CloudinaryContext, Transormations} from 'cloudinary-react'`
4. Use a CloudianryContext referencing your cloud name, Image component referencing the publicId of the image, and, if desired, a Transormation

```

   <CloudinaryContext cloudName="your-cloudname" >
            <Image publicId={img} >
              <Transformation height="128" width="173" crop="fill" />
            </Image>
    </CloudinaryContext>

```
