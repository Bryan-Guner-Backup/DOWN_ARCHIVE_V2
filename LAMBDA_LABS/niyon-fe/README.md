## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/35RQNtt9/labspt10-niyon)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/ffa6c91910394e0cad11cf6c51219336?v=d32644f1e5734ecb943d2bad435c17ec)

Niyon is an online platform that aims to connect young coders with mentors. Starting a job in a new location or new industry is extremely difficult. Niyon helps young professionals increase their confidence skills, meet colleagues in a new location and find support to help them develop the skills needed for their coding career. Niyon will be launching a pilot of its mentorship platform in West Africa and aims to reduce the unemployment rate in those countries.


### Key Features

-    Give the ability for inexperienced professionals who seek tech mentorship in West Africa to be connected with a mentor of their choosing via different filtering fields
-    Give mentors and mentees the ability to text/video chat in real time
-    Give mentees a place to ask questions by way of a forum
-    Site contains a newsfeed that displays relevant tech/career articles
-    Site has a map to visualize users around them for potential meetups

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React

-    Performance - ReactJS its using a virtual DOM that provides superior performance
-    reusable Components - React provides a component based structure. You can re-use components anywhere you need. As a result, (1) your app has consistent look and feel, (2) code re-use makes it easier to maintain and grow your codebase, and (3) it is easier to develop your app.
-    is such a popular library, many modules are available, as is plenty of up-to-date information about it.

#### Front end deployed to AWS Amplify

#### [Back end] built using: https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/niyon-be

#### Node/Express/Knex

-    Node is a server side environment where javascript can run. Having both our client and server code with the same language is helpful to our team's communication and integration.
-    Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
