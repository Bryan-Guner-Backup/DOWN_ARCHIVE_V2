## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/uyrYNcIv/labs22-beerthoven)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Beerthoven-2ac2dcac96d741fc8c5ff645cf0ccaea)

[UX Design Files](https://www.figma.com/file/CEPeeLCgftmibKev07r1k8/Beerthoven%2C-Emily?node-id=179%3A0)

The Beerthoven Concert Series is a nonprofit classical music concert series with a mission of lowering the barrier to classical music both culturally and financially. Dress how you want, clap when you want, be yourself, and have fun. And have a drink! On us. For $10 if you're a student and $20 if you're not, you get (often) Grammy award winning performances, unlimited local craft beer on tap, unlimited coffee from local and remote locations, and unlimited free food and snacks from local bakeries.

Beerthoven also has an educational arm called Craft Music Lessons, wherein we teach adults 21+ to play an instrument in a relaxed setting; usually a brewery, with complimentary beer.

As we are soon approaching our 6th year in operation, we have a growing need for our data (currently collected in Google Sheets) to be easier to navigate, store, review, visualize, export, etc.

### Key Features

- Creating an account and authenticating with Okta
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete Events
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete People
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete Events
- Read, Update, and Delete Users
- Render charts that display data

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React

- Allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page
- Is fast, scalable, and simple
- Works on user interfaces in the application

#### GraphQL

- More productive for front and back end developers
- Instead of having to create an endpoint for every request, you simply ask for the data you want
- Using GraphQL gives us the opportunity to learn this upcoming technology, and would fit well in our stack

#### Apollo

- Apollo has built-in local state handling that lets you store your local data inside of the cache alongside your remote data
- Simple and easy to use by having all data fetching inside of a useQuery Hook
- Using Apollo Client allows you to utilize GraphQL as a unified interface for all of your data

#### Ant Design (React Component Library)

- Components are easily customizable
- Pairs very well specifically with React
- Ant's Design team builds their design based on the design values of Natural, Certain, Meaningful, and Growing

#### Chart.js

- Intuitive and easy to learn
- Simple documentation
- Several different chart options

#### Front end deployed to https://www.beerthoven.dev/

#### [Backend Repo](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/beerthoven-be) built using:

#### Prismatopia

- Almost all of your node modules are ready to go after initilazing from Make file
- Apollo server is generated for you
- No setup needed for Docker and AWS as long as you have your environmental variables in place

#### Prisma

- Great flexibility when creating APIs
- Very easy and user friendly setup
- Offers great developer tools

#### Apollo Server

- Apollo has a huge platform that's constantly growing with new updates
- Apollo offers a massive amount of libraries
- Apollo is great at connecting with other frameworks

#### GraphQL

- GraphQL fetches the exact amount of data that you want and does not overfetch or underfetch
- Allows web and mobile clients to request the exact event details they want to render
- Increases performance by preventing overfetching

#### Docker

- It can deploy within seconds
- High security with ensuring that containers are completely separate from each other
- Docker gives a reliability and consistency across your team

## APIs

#### https://${OKTA_DOMAIN}/oauth2/default

This is the authentication domain that is used to redirect someone to OKTA, verify them, and then redirect them back to our site.

#### https://apollo.beerthoven.dev

Data backend. Built on Prismatopia (GraphQL, Apollo Server, Prisma).

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENTID - the client ID for our Okta application
    *  REACT_APP_OKTA_DOMAIN - okta.beerthoven.dev

## Testing

- React Testing Library + Jest: These come with mocking, parallelizing test runs, and snapshots.

## Installation Instructions

- npm install
- Setup .ENV
- Has to be running on localhost:3000 for Okta to work

## Other Scripts

    * start - start the development server
    * build - create a build
    * test - runs test scripts
    * eject - opt out of create-react-app encapsulation
    * coverage - generate test coverage report
    * coverage-win - generate test coverage report (Windows)

#### Feature Requests

We would love to hear from you about new features which would improve this app and further the aims of our project. Please provide as much detail and information as possible to show us why you think your new feature should be implemented.

#### Pull Requests

If you have developed a patch, bug fix, or new feature that would improve this app, please submit a pull request. It is best to communicate your ideas with the developers first before investing a great deal of time into a pull request to ensure that it will mesh smoothly with the project.

#### Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new plist variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
- Ensure that your code conforms to our existing code conventions and test coverage.
- Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
