# Encon - Front End
![MIT](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/743d6ca437fec2ad80985c1208501b7c7b4b97ae/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f7061636b61676973742f6c2f646f637472696e652f6f726d2e737667)

EnCon lets users see and track their energy usage. The front end is built with a mobile first approach using React.
The app allows us to pick a device and input it's usage in hours and days then it calculates the amount of electricity it uses (in kwh) and the amount of money it will cost. If a user registers a profile they can track multiple devices with handy visualizations (graphs and charts) of the usage.
