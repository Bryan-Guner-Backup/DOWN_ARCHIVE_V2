            To provide the most effective services in moving people from

            sure that clients are not counted twice if services are received by
            more than one agency, we need to collect some personal information.
            We need: name, birth date, race, ethnicity, social security number,
            etc. You may be asked questions on topics like: income sources,
            veteran status, education, and disabilities. This information is

            receive. You have the right to refuse to provide this information.
