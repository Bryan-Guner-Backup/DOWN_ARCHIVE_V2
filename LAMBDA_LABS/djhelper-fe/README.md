# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_BACKEND_HOST - this is "http://localhost:8000" if running locally, OR the back end deployed url if using the deployed back end: "https://api.dj-helper.com/"

    * REACT_APP_FRONTEND_HOST = 'http://localhost:3000/'  - if running locally, with whichever port you are using for the front end.

    * CI=true - this is needed to run the test coverage reports for Code Climate

    * REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID - you can get this by registering for the Spotify API

# Testing

Testing is done using the @testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/react, and @testing-library/user-event packages. Tests are located in the [src/tests directory](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/djhelper-fe/tree/master/src/tests). Tests are grouped into files by component.

Our UX team member also runs surveys and user tests. Her results can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/User-Research-b5b3512626624497bd973628842a8b2a).

# Installation Instructions

To get the app running locally:

1. Clone this repo

2. `npm i` to install all required dependencies

3. `npm start` to start the local server and run the app in the development mode.

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

   - The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

   - You will also see any lint errors in the console.

5. If you want to use localhost for your back end, see the [back end documentation](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/djhelper-be/blob/master/README.md) for instructions on setting that up.

## Other Scripts

- **build** - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

  - It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  - The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

- **start** - Runs the app in the development mode.

  - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  - The page will reload if you make edits.

  - You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- **test** - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

  - See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

- **eject** - Copies the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them

  - **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

  - If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

  - Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

  - You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

- **coverage** - Runs a coverage test and report.

- Ensure that your code conforms to our existing code conventions and test coverage.
- Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
