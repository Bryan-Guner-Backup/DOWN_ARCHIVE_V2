                We invite you to engage with your local communities with our new
                social media app. As we are just starting, we have not placed
                restrictions or boundaries for inviting others to your culinary
                events. Those boundaries will come later in our journey to help
                you only see events from your neighborhood. We look forward to
                making this journey with you!
