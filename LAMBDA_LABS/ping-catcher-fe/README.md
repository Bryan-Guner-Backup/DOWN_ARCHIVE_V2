## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/i98IsBhu/labs-pt11-ping-catcher)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Ping-Catcher-7437dcf59e0049eaad75aae8e0b0fae1)

Ping catcher is a software solution that allows one to prioritize, color code, organize, and filter incoming notifications.

There are too many distractions from mentions/pings through the day. Work flow and deep work is highly disrupted because of it. Currently, there is no method of organizing important/high priority communication from the rest.

### Key Features

- Security with Okta
- Organize pings by categories
- Organize pings by color
- Snooze ping to review later
- Customize dashboard

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

React, Okta, React-testing, Material-Ui

#### React

- React create elements in a virtual DOM.
- React creates and maintains state.
- React will only change elements needing to be changed.
- React does not need to refresh the entire page.

#### Front end deployed to https://aws.amazon.com

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/ping-catcher-be) built using:

#### Node, Express, PostgresSQl (also known as Postgres)

- Express is an easy and common framework for creating server end points.
- Middleware is easy to create and implement
- PostgresSQL make it easy to protect data

# APIs

## Authentication API here

Authentication for the App is handled by Okta. We utilize Okta's Oauth system and backend. We pass the user information to Okta. Okta verifies the credentials and sends back a token we use to give access to the user. If the user is not registered, we have set up Okta to allow them to register into the Okta system.

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

Production Okta server

- REACT_APP_OKTA_CLIENT_ID=<your client id>
- REACT_APP_OKTA_ORG_URL=<your server url>
- SPA_CLIENT_ID=<your client id>

Create your account at [Okat](https://developer.okta.com). Follow the docs to create your Okta server. Paste in your client id's and the server url.

Development Okta server

- REACT_APP_OKTA_IMPLICIT_CALLBACK_URL=<http://localhost:300/implicit/callback>
- REACT_APP_OKTA_API_MESSAGES=<http://localhost:300/api/messages>
- PORT=300

Once your Okta server is up, you can add local development for working and testing. This allows you to run production and development from the same server. Review Okta docs.

# Testing

We used the @testing-library/react and @testing-library/jest-dom for the testing of this App. To run a single test, run `yarn test` from the terminal. To watch your tests and run on save, run `yarn test:watch`

# Installation Instructions

The Frontend utilizes Yarn while the Backend utilizes NPM. To get started with the Frontend, clone the Frontend into it's own folder on your system. Run `yarn install` in the terminal to install all the packages from the package.json. In the 'root' directory, create your '.env' file and then copy and paste the environment variables from above into it. Save and run `yarn start`.

## Other Scripts

    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
    * test:watch - watch's the **tests** directory for changes and runs test's on save
