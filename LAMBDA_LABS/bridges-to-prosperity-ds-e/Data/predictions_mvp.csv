With this river width we assum that the the community themselves may be able to construct a sustainable timber bridge as the river never flood during the rainy season. Rugarama Bridge kinks Giti and Rwamiko Sector the community crosses Gihurura River for agriculture purpose and there is also a market in Rwamiko Sector. It is also a small ditch less than 1.0m width. ,
1010846,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BAJ confirms rejection. Nyamirambo 2 bridge links Giti and Muko Sector on Gihurura River Gihurura River is narrow and it has some timbers that are currently help the community to pass but the bridge is not strong. Nyamirambo 2 bridge is mostly used by the students of Nyagatoma Primary School. This bridge can be easily constructed by using timber bridge as the river narrow and doens't flood. It's a narrow stream less 1.5m. ,
1010847,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BAJ confirms rejection. Plans to build vehicular bridge. Mayogi Bridge is made of 3 timbers that help people to cross Burimbi River . Burimbi River is deep and it floods several times during the rainy seasonand those timbers washed away by the floods. When Burimbi River floods it blocks more activities like Agriculture movent of people to: Muko Health Center Muko Secondary School Rugaragara Primary School and Rugaragara Commercial Center. It is difficultto find replacement timbers ,
1010849,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BAJ confirms rejection. Rubindi Bridge links Manyagiro and Cyumba Sector on Rusebeya River. Cyumba health center and Cyumba secondary school From Rurembo Bridge to Rubindi bridge there is like 1.5km downstream. Due to the the severity of the river during the rainy season it was considered not very needed. ,
1010908,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rukondo Bridge links Gicumbi and Rulindo District on Mutete and Buyoga Sector. Rukondo Bridge has some timbers. Gatare Market Mutete church Mutete market and Nyabisiga Primary School are the Primary Social Services that people looking for. In case of flooding water will take 2 days to reach on the normal level and there is no alternative crossing point . ,
1010915,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nearest location for a feasible bridge is 500 meters downstream. There is a vehicular bridge 700 meters upstream. Locals present at the site said if the bridge was built down stream no one would use it. They would walk upstream and use the vehicular bridge. That is what people currently do during the rainy season. For this reason the site is rejected. We find that Rwafundi Bridge has been removed by the floods the community currently pass through the water . Normaly the community use Rwafandi Bridge to access Gaseke market and Rwafandi center .Rwafandi bridge links Mutete and Rutare Sector on Mwange River. The community tried to put on some timbers that help them to cross the river but they usually be removed by the flooding in the rainy season. When the river floods the alternative crossing point is Kwidigiri Bridge in 1.5km from Rwagifandi Bridge. ,
