# Deployment

## Architecture 

You will design and document your architecture to deploy your model and integrate it into your product. For example:

[Labs 17 Cryptolytic](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/cryptolytic-ds) architecture (diagram made with [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/))

[Labs 19 Tally AI](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/tally-ai-ds) architecture (diagram made with [Figma](https://www.figma.com/))

## FastAPI

FastAPI is an alternative to Flask. It gives you "automatic interactive API documentation."

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk

[AWS in Plain English](https://expeditedsecurity.com/aws-in-plain-english/) says "Elastic Beanstalk should have been called Amazon Platform as a Service. Use this to move your app hosted on Heroku to AWS when it gets too expensive."
