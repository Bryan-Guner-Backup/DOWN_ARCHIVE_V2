# Cycle 3: Iterate

You don't have to complete cycle 3, but you do have to plan for it. 

To complete Labs, you must complete 2 product cycles. But, you must plan 3 release canvases. The release canvas is your planning document for a product cycle.

## Add another user feature

You can go back to the beginning with a new user feature. [Choose a new DS problem to work on](planning.md#choose-ds-problems-to-work-on) and work on [cycle 1](cycle1.md) tasks.

## Or, iterate on your current feature(s)

You can continue with your current user feature(s). Iterate on [cycle 2](cycle2.md) tasks to improve your product. Don't forget about [documentation + presentation](documentation.md) too!
