## Begin with baselines

In Cycle 1, you're required to start making a chart like this. Label the axes, with time on the x-axis, and your evaluation metric on the y-axis.  Then plot the red horizontal lines, representing baselines and user expectations.

This will prepare you for Cycle 2, when you will track your team's progress like [how the EFF tracks AI research progress](https://www.eff.org/ai/metrics), with a datapoint for each of your iterations. 


## Deploy baseline API

_* Recommended in cycle 1 for Labs 23, required for Labs 24_
