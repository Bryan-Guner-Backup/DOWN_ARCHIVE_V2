# Planning

## Contribute to Product Vision Document

PVDs are at the product level — all tracks contribute to the product, so all students are required to work together on the PVD. While working on PVDs, students are exposed to the product management process and concepts like customer discovery and going from vision to planning. You will be a part of this process in your future workplaces and we find it very valuable for all students to be involved. <!-- https://lambdaschoolstudents.slack.com/archives/GMMNKK70D/p1584105198160800?thread_ts=1583942184.088800 -->

Plans can be flexible and iterative. We don't expect DS students to stick to your original plan — but we do expect you to make one.  [President Eisenhower is famously quoted:](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/18/planning/) _"In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable."_ This is true of DS too!

For the **Technical Research** and **Architecture** sections of the PVD, explore some options and make some initial hypotheses. But you'll be doing technical research and making architecture decisions all throughout your time in Labs. So you do not need to finalize these during the Planning phase.

## Identify user problems that DS can help solve

Look for user problems that could be solved with any of these patterns:

- Automate tasks when you can't give step-by-step instructions, but you can give many labeled examples
- Predict or estimate uncertain information
- Give users personalized recommendations

Refer to these additional resources:

## Audit your data

During the Planning phase, you are required to audit your data. What data do you have now? What data do you need, to solve the problem? What data can you get?

You could make a table that looks something like this: 

|                        | Size | Features | Labels |
|------------------------|------|----------|--------|
| What data do you have? |      |          |        |
| What do you need?      |      |          |        |
| What can you get?      |      |          |        |

Then fill in the table to answer the questions and complete your data audit.

You may have heard that we don't write code in Labs during the Planning phase. This is *generally* true. However, DS is permitted and expected to write some code to do your data audit and identify DS opportunities. This will be exploratory code, probably in notebooks. You probably won't use any of this code in production for the solution you deliver.

## Choose DS problem(s) to work on

You will choose at least one **user feature** to help build with Data Science.

DS teams will probably deliver fewer features than Web teams during Labs. For example, Web may release three features in cycle 1, then three more features in cycle 2. But DS may work on a single user feature across both cycles. This is accepted and expected!

You will list your user feature(s) in the **Product Vision Document** for your project, and in the **Release Canvas** documents for each cycle.

The Release Canvas template also asks for a **Lo-fi prototype** (mockup) for each feature. DS students should help make mockups. Refer to these resources:
