# Expectations

## Contribute daily

Success starts with showing up. Are you showing up to participate with your team, on Slack, Zoom, and GitHub?

Do you have something to show for your work, some tangible artifact, each day?

This doesn't have to be just production code. For example, documentation is valuable, such as a data dictionary, with definitions, assumptions, and metadata. Jupyter notebooks with exploratory analysis are helpful to learn about the data and refine project plans.

Regardless of the work format, it should be committed to GitHub or Notion. To help teams review and troubleshoot their work, we need to be able to see it in central repositories.

## Machine Learning will be less than 50% of your time (but should be more than 0%)
