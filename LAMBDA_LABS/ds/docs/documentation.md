# Documentation + Presentation

## API documentation

[FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) is recommended because it gives you "automatic interactive API documentation"!

## Architecture diagram

You will design and document your architecture to deploy your model and integrate it into your product. For example:
