## Slack Quotes

Part of what makes Labby unique from just another bunch of code is that Labby has a persona of a helpful and approachable bot. This help to establish Labby as a resource for students and staff to interact with during day-to-day operations.

The functions in this module drop random inspirational or simply helpful quotes from Lambda students, staff and our hiring manager partners.

## Slack DAO

The DAO in this module is useful for interacting with the Slack API with less lines of code.
