# Team Reel

This is a video platform app for teams. Team members inside an organization answer a regularly scheduled prompt with a video response. Then team members are able to review and rate eachothers videos to provide helpful feedback.

> This is an experimental documentation for the project.

## ðŸš€ Mission
Team Real strives to be the best platform of choice for teams to practice their professional interviewing skills by providing all the features necessary to help them get feedback from peers and machine learning techniques to improve. Presenting remotely can be challenging. Team Reel helps facilitate the practice necessary.

## ðŸ˜« Problem
Submitting video responses to prompts to be reviewed by a team lead and peers is clumbsy and inefficient. Wasting lots of time trying to get everyone to watch eachothers videos and provide responses results in no responses.
