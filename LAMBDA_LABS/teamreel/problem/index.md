# Problem & Pain

> Recording asychronous videos as a team and providing digestable feedback on those videos is an insane time dump and feels way more work than its worth.

## üîç Exploring the pain and the problem
It seems to be an issue of having to use too many different tools and no aggregate view of the data and commentary.

This was attempted in labs 21 for a moment with google drive submissions and it was quickly realized that it wayyyy too much work.

**These are the steps that were taken:**
- Students would be sent the prompt for the week.
- Friday they would record their responses via webcamp or phone selfie video.
- They would submit by uploading it to a shared google drive folder
- TLs and SLs would make sure everyone had submitted.
- The labs manager would then open the folder and review all the videos.
- SOOO MUCH TIME wasted
