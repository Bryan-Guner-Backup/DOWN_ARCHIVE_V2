# Guides

The guides will be divided into separate categories. A category corresponds to a specific area of concern found in the Labs experience. The categories can all be viewed in the menu.

## Completeness <a id="completeness"></a>

These guides do not cover all possibilities. Many are purposely omitted so as to require the individuals and teams in Labs to discover their own solutions.

When in doubt, please open an issue or submit a PR to start a discussion.

## Contributing <a id="contributing"></a>

These guides will morph over time as we adapt to the ever-changing technology landscape. In addition, the guides will embrace a subset of all of aspects of the Labs experience, so that teams have some general guidance. In order to ensure that these guides are inclusive of the needs of all Labs groups, each new standard or change to an existing standard will be ratified by approval from 3 Labs Tech Leads.
