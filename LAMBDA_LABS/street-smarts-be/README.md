#### Backend delpoyed at [streesmarts-labs24](https://streetsmarts-labs24.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **npm install** to install all required dependencies
- **npm run server** to start the local server
- **npm test** to start server using testing environment

## Project Overview

StreetSmarts (name might change in production) is a tool to impartially compare
the overall cost and emissions during ownership across the spectrum of internal
combustion engines to electric vehicles. We make our calculations using the
industry standard set by the EPA. Users can search cars by make, model, year and
trim package to determine which car is best for their next purchase based on
their needs.

### Express / knex

This project is built with Express. Express is an easy to http server framework
that the team was familiar with. We used Postgres to deploy our backend database
on Heroku. Heroku has great support for Postgres.

# Data Model

See `epa_vehicles_schema.txt`.

## Actions

`search()` -> Returns all cars

`searchById(id)` -> Returns a single car by ID

`getModel()` -> Returns all car models

`getMake()` -> Returns all car makes

`getYear()` -> Returns all years

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own
environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

- `DATABASE_URL`: The url to connect to the heroku database. Can change. If the
  server stops connecting to the database, try updating the `DATABASE_URL`.
  - Append `?ssl=true` to the end of the url
- Set `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` equal to `0`. This will allow your computer
  to connect over SSL.
