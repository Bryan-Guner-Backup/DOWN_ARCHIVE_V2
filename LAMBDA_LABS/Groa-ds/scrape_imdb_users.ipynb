Essentially it's a road movie, and I like road movies, and it has a distinct sense of humor that borders on surreal while never breaking completely into fantasy.  It's shockingly funny too.  Not just the Ferns segments, which maintain the web series' style, but the surrounding road segments as well.  Will Ferrell as a coked up executive version of himself was especially great.  It keeps to Ferns humor and it's hilarious.\",\n",

       "    'comment': 'A movie I\\'ve had to sit on for several days and I think I\\'ll have to sit on even longer.  Controversial, dangerous, these are words thrown around a lot with this movie.  I guess I see why, but maybe not for the right reason.  It\\'s asking questions, but a lot of people are getting the wrong thing out of those questions.  Are they questions that have been asked before?  Have they been asked in a similar way?  Sure, but maybe not in this climate and certainly not with this character, and that\\'s what makes it different. Without going too deep into my own theories, the biggest thing I got out of it is \"help people\".  There were so many points where this slow-motion car crash could have been stopped, but it didn\\'t.  Another thing is, how much are other people to blame?  These are interesting questions, and what makes it more interesting is knowing this character and where he ends up.  As to the violence, none of the violence is particularly over the top in a Deadpool or Michael Bay sort of way, but that\\'s sort of what makes it more uncomfortable.  It\\'s grounded and unnerving.  It\\'s also very Joker-ish, with some scenes that are weirdly playful in a bizarre way where you don\\'t really know what he\\'s going to do.  This was a unique direction to take this character, and Joaquin Phoenix kills it as Arthur/Joker with a empathic psychopath.  It\\'s a thoughtful but uncomfortable feel-bad sort of movie I\\'m still thinking about and really want to talk about.  I don\\'t get that sort of movie often enough.',\n",

       "    'comment': \"Godamn what happened to these movies.  Starting with low rent Point Break we're now at a movie that honestly I wouldn't be surprised if this started out as a script for G.I. Joe 3.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, just be prepared, it's ridiculous, on par with the level of insanity we see in most superhero movies these days.  The problems that arise there is there are some prolonged sequences that are so riddled with CGI is basically watching a cartoon or a video game cutscene.  Now, I like cartoons, hell I even like some video game cutscenes, but with those there's a consistency in knowing what you're getting compared to the rest of the product.  Here, the movie's really at it's best when the effects stay real and even a little more grounded.  They can still be ridiculous over-the-top fun, but once it becomes a cartoon it started to lose me.  That being said, the action in this is still a helluva lot of fun, and Idris Elba makes good villain.  The final sequence of old tech vs new tech is genuinely great, and unlike anything I've see in one of these Fast movies before.  And yeah, the dynamic of Hobbs and Shaw is a lot of fun, playing off the toxic alpha personalities the two of them both possess.  It's not the best of the F&F films, but it's a solid entry in ridiculousness.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"Pretty much a perfect saga here.  My only real issues with Toy Story 4 are that it could have been funnier, a lot of the other characters are sidelined for Woody and Bo's story, and how it's ultimately kind of unnecessary.  But even these issues I can kind of justify.  It's more about the emotions than the comedy, the story really is Woody's story, and despite being unnecessary it does take the Toy Story story into a new direction.  It visits a lot of familiar territory, but does so in some new ways.  The villain for example does not have your standard Toy Story villain ending, and without diving too deep into spoilers it's kind of a tearjerker.  And yes the whole thing is a tearjerker.  The return of Bo Peep I found an interesting choice, but she wasn't the most dynamic character in the first two films.  Here, they expand on her a lot while still keeping the essence of her character, and she becomes on of the most interesting characters in this whole franchise through her arc.  And yeah that ending, it broke me, honestly I was holding it together fine but there is a line from Buzz that comes at the end that if you're not crying yet, you will.  Toy Story 4 doesn't quite feel as polished as some other Pixar films, but it's still an incredibly solid film with characters we love and some new ones that are a lot of fun.  I haven't even talked about Forky, he's a spectacular new entry.  It's not a part of the story I wanted, but now that it's here I'm glad I got it.  It's got all the heart and beauty and enough of the comedy to be a worthy entry in this franchise.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"A film with a fun high concept but it's focus in the wrong place, Yesterday is charming enough, but ultimately disappointing.  It's not a bad movie per se, but it's just not a very good movie.  The idea presents a lot of fun concepts.  One direction you could go is full fantasy and explore how this parallel world came to be, but the film ultimately ignores that entirely despite giving weird hints here and there that seem to go nowhere.  You could go into what this means for the explosion of fame, the ideas of how the music industry has changed from when The Beatles exploded to now, and at the films best moments it does this and it can be interesting.  In the end what the movie is really interested in doing is using this really fun concept to tell another boring love story.  Lilly James is charming as all hell, but she's playing a character that just isn't interesting and her motivations are either boring tropes or borderline appalling.  The first half of the movie I was kind of into it, but when it became clear any intrigue into the world of fame was going to be sidelined for blind praising of The Beatles and a boring love story, the movie lost me.  I didn't hate it.  It still has a certain charm to it, but ultimately it's just a lot of missed potential.\",\n",

       "    'comment': 'An apparently controversial ending to the Skywalker saga, I\\'m curious how this film will age.  Afterall, we forget but Return of the Jedi was not well liked when it first came out.  In any case, what did I think?  Honestly, I really liked it.  Yes, I\\'ve heard the criticism about the cleanup of The Last Jedi and the fetch quest stuff and \"that\" kiss and while I do agree that these are problems, they never ruined the movie for me.  Honestly some of the things that ruined the movie for other people I kinda\\' liked.  The idea that the Emperor has been in the shadows and has even created some of the villains of the previous movies I actually really dug.  Partly just because it\\'s great to see Ian McDiarmid back on screen, but also having an overarching villain for all 9 movies I kinda\\' like.  I like the banter of the characters.  Some people say they argue, but honestly I think this is just how friends talk in tense situations and having been with friends in tense situations it felt familiar.  And then there\\'s the action, holy crap, this is some of the best Star Wars action I\\'ve ever seen.  During the final confrontation there was honestly a point where I was whispering to myself \"go, go!\" for a character to get to a place, and even though I knew from a narrative standpoint of course they would get there, I still felt uncertain.  I was never bored by the movie, in its action or in its character moments.  The character turns we get feel strong and natural, and at times even moving.  In the end it\\'s not a perfect end because I don\\'t think this whole thing was mapped out as well as it could have been.  But as it is, honestly, I actually loved it.',\n",

       "    'comment': 'Similar to what Rian Johnson did for Brick he\\'s now doing for the whodunit genre.  Knives Out is really a classic story of it\\'s kind set in modern day with Daniel Craig even playing a very clear Hercule Poirot type character.  There\\'s a bit more humor and self-awareness than a lot of those classic stories, but never to the degree that it takes away from the twists and the mysteries.  And there are some good twists.  In fact one of the biggest mysteries is revealed midway through the movie which actually led me to check the time thinking \"damn, are we near the end already?\" but nope, they were just taking the movie on a left turn to Albuquerque that I did not anticipate and changed the course of the whole thing.  Johnson has constructed a great mystery in the spirit of the classics.  The fun of it too is how many twists there are without it ever feeling overdone.  In that way also you can predict a few twists, but not another, so have fun feeling smart and still feel surprised by the others.  It\\'s just a classic fun film of its type.',\n",

Telling a bit of an origin story to the mythos of Santa Claus through the eyes of a mailman, it\\'s a movie that\\'s at times very funny but usually just incredible charming.  If it has a choice between a charming character moment or a big laugh, it\\'ll go for the charm, and that\\'s okay.  It makes a very sweet movie that never feels saccharine, but just right.  Oh and did I mention it\\'s beautiful?  Because holy crap this animation is gorgeous.  If I had a complaint it\\'d be that there\\'s a couple pop song moments that don\\'t quite fit in which almost feels inescapable in an animated film these days, but the biggest thing is that in the third act we get one of those \"liar revealed\" tropes.  It\\'s an annoying trope and I hate it, but fortunately it doesn\\'t last very long and admittedly it does propel the film towards its final message which is a good one.

One of the best of the critters on the run entry, and I do like it's slow-burn of turning from charming family Christmas movie to straight up horror movie by the end.  It's not an abrupt turn exactly either like From Dusk Till Dawn, it's a bit more gradual, but by the end it's clear the turn has happened.

If you're anticipating something on the level of Krampus or other American Christmas horror entries, it's not really that.  It is definitely a darker take on Christmas, but it does so with a much cheekier edge.  It's a slow-burn movie, more character driven, and based on ideas and storytelling moreso than outlandish imagery and effects.  That said, there's some pretty insane stuff near the end, but a lot of this movie is the characters learning the legend and figuring out what's going on for themselves.  For that, it still works for me.  I enjoyed the characters, and even though I knew what they were going to discover how they discovered it was still fun to watch.  It's a weird little film.\",\n",

Honestly, even by Michael Bay standards, it's kinda…good?  Don't get me wrong, it's over the top and ridiculous as all hell, but unlike the worst of Michael Bay there is a great deal that remains practical, they actually keep it at a reasonable runtime (2 hours rather than 3!), and they mix up the action so you never get bored of one type of thing happening.  It almost feels like Michael Bay used all he learned from those s***y transformer sequels to actually make a good movie here.  Unfortunately, the story is where he hasn't learned much.  The basic premise we get is fine.  Despite being both outlandish and bare-bones, I still want to see them succeed.  The problem is in how it's told.  Oftentimes it will jump around in how the team got together and with Bay's cocaine-fueled directing style this out-of-order narrative becomes a little disorienting.  It also tries to have something of a bigger message about our current state of the world and dictators.  Not a bad idea per se, I'm just not sure this is the movie to do it in.  Still, it's a fun movie.  It's surprisingly restrained in all the bad things about Bay but goes full force in the fun stuff.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"A film about friendship and forgiveness more than a film about Mr. Rogers, it's told through the lens of a friendship with Mr. Rogers.  That's really the best way you could do this type of story though I think.  Tom Hanks is such a powerhouse icon himself it might be hard to see Rogers through him, but he's so damn good that pretty quickly you just fall into it.  The growing friendship is genuine and intriguing as hell.  Honestly the best part of the movie is scenes of these two clashing personalities just talking to each other.  It's so simple, just a room and two opposing types chatting, and it's riveting as all hell.  Seeing Rogers break down his barriers to the human inside is heartwarming and real.  It's just a sweet movie, and a fascinating look at what this legend would have been like when the cameras weren't rolling.  The answer, it turns out, is not all that different.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"While it's miles ahead of the Jim Carrey one purely on charm and appearance alone, it's still not a great movie.  It's still a little conflicted in following the source material and making up its own stuff, and it does sometimes go too far into modern pop culture sense.  Compared to previous Illumination entry The Lorax though and especially compared to the Carrey film, it's surprisingly charming and even makes some attempt at being timeless and faithful to the classic.  Is it entirely successful?  No, but I appreciate the attempt.  I also appreciate the new focus, where we only see a hint of the Grinch's origins with the focus much more on his stealing Christmas, and the origins we do get were much sadder for me and didn't betray the character of the Whos the way the Carrey film did.  There's still a lot of dumb stuff though, like a punk skater Cindy-Lou, and forced message with her mom that just didn't work for me.  But in terms of visuals and just Christmas spirit the movie has it.  It looks great, and just feels like Christmas.  It's not great, but I liked it.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"The biggest issue this movie has is with its villain.  I guess I won't spoil it, but really if you've read the comics, played the games, or just googled any of the character names of people in this movie you know who it is and yet they treat it like this big reveal.  The first movie had something of a villain reveal too, but they handled it in such a way that it really worked.  Here, it just doesn't.  On top of that, his motives and overall goals are a little difficult to follow.  Regardless, it's still a helluva fun ride.  His missions were some of the ones I enjoyed the most in the Spider-Man games, and it allows for some truly mind-bending trippy visuals later in the film.  That's where the film shines the highest, in its warped inception-ey trip-out sequences.  Also, in it's character moments with the heroes.  Tom Holland is still the best Spider-Man, and damnit all Zendaya is really winning me over.  Those two are just really cute, and their developing relationship is charming as hell.  That relationship and seeing Spidey try to fill Tony's shoes (spoilers) is great stuff.  It's another solid, if not perfect, Spider-Man film.\",\n",

Adapting stories like Harold or Jangly Man, they don\\'t follow the originals exactly, but capture their spirit and have some genuinely creepy moments.  However, then there\\'s the stuff in between with the teenagers solving the mystery of the book and that stuff gets really hokey.  The lead girl\\'s acting also sways back and forth wildly.  Sometimes she\\'s genuinely incredible, other times she\\'s soap opera melodramatic.  Then of course we have our studio mandated \"maybe things aren\\'t so bad\" ending that puts a bow on top.  So yeah, it\\'s a mixed bag.  But as everyone else has said, it\\'s good gateway horror.  There are some genuinely creepy scenes that have a ton of creativity behind how they pull of their scares that I really wish more horror would attempt.  But then you have you\\'re Nancy Drew time-is-running out mystery they cut back to.  I\\'m conflicted on this one.  However, the stuff that\\'s good is just too good to miss for fans of the book series.',\n",

Sure, I want movies that take bold risks in new directions, but other times I just want to see a bunch of likable characters kill zombies in slow motion and that's what we get here.  We see new types of zombies which is pretty cool, we see some new locations, but at the end of the day it's just a fun movie.  It doesn't try to be anything more than what it is, it's just fun!

I have the same problems with it as I did with its predecessor, that being that the grotesque pleasure it takes in human cruelty becomes hard to tolerate at times.  However, at other times there is a genuine creativity in its cruelty and even an art to it's horror.  Its final moments are almost beautiful.  The fact that it shows these psychopaths in their murderous moments as inhuman monsters giving terrifying monologues but also just shooting the shit and eating ice cream is kind of intriguing.  It's brilliant and also horrifying, which I guess is the point, even if it is hard to tolerate at times.  It's good, even when it's hard to stomach.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"At it's best it's a brutally entertaining thrill ride homage to classic horror films of the 70s.  At it's worst it's a sickening exercise in depravity and the relishing of human suffering.  Which side of the spectrum you most find it will really depend on your tolerance level.  I guess I'm somewhere in the middle.  I love the gritty gross feel akin to Texas Chainsaw and similar films, but the sheer brutality and pornographic enjoyment of torture got to be frankly uncomfortable at times.  At other times though, it's a godamn blast.  While it's controversial, I actually love the final act.  Supposedly this all started as a pitch for a haunted house attraction, and I can see that.  It's a bit much, but the bat*** insane Resident Evil style shenanigans are just fun for me.  It's a mixed bag, some of it's really unpleasant, but a lot of it I really like.\",\n",

       "    'comment': 'I really love the horror movie at a haunted house attraction premise, and there aren\\'t enough movies that take advantage of that idea.  More-and-more are, but it\\'s such a ripe idea for ideas I\\'d really love to see even more.  Interestingly this one is more about the build up to the night of, but it still works, perhaps even better.  The horror is actually very subtle, and builds on a type of horror and unease that personal freaks the s***t  out of me.  That being, that feeling of \"wait, did that things just move?\" or \"was that there before?\".  There tons of those moments in this movie.  The moments where someone looks away for a second, and looks back and something has changed just slightly, but noticeably enough; or where they turn on the camera and something new is in the room and you the viewer notice it before they do.  Stuff that creeps me out more than any jump scare or any creep with a knife, something about it feels more genuine.  It taps into that real world feeling of \"wait, did I lock the door? Or did someone open it?\"\\nOn top of that, it\\'s just a masterfully crafted movie.  The characters are actually pretty likable for the most part.  Yeah you do kinda\\' get that feeling of \"leave you idiots!\", but they do address it enough to move past it.  Their relationships feel real, and their acting feels human.  Even the documentary structure of the editing gets explained in an acceptable way.  It\\'s a genuinely great found footage movie.  If you don\\'t like the genre, it probably won\\'t sway you, but if you do it\\'s one of the best I\\'ve seen.',\n",

And, yeah, that is sort of its baseline.  But even at it\\'s worst it\\'s still charmingly Christmasy and just plain cute.  If that\\'s not your thing, I get it, but this time of year I like it.  What really elevates it though is the godamn delightful performance from Anna Kendrick who is just freaking adorable in this role.  She is giving a 110% to this performance and it is kind of incredible, she is so insanely charming and likable throughout it just makes the whole thing likable.  What also helps the movie is a broad spectrum of Christmas showing the ups and downs of the holidays.  Not the REAL downs, this is Disney after-all, but they do address that the fact that the holiday isn\\'t the best time for everyone.  There are also a couple of genuine laugh out loud moments that really caught me off guard.  Maybe it\\'s just because I wasn\\'t expecting them in my Disney Christmas movie, but a couple of the jokes in here really got me.  Overall though, it is what it is, a Disney Christmas movie with Anna Kendrick.  If any part of that sentence appeals to you, you\\'ll get about what you expect.',\n",

       "    'comment': \"As a conclusion to over a decades worth of storytelling, it's got a lot to live up to, and it's about as good as you could really hope for it to be.  Overall, I really do like Infinity War better.  At the end of the day, Infinity War was just a wildly new experience, it was such a gamechanger and crowd-pleaser.  Not only that, Infinity War I think had a better final battle.  This final battle, while boasting the biggest ensemble of Marvel heroes we've ever seen on screen, is weirdly dark and muddied in CGI scenery compared to the battle at Wakanda from Infinity War.  Also I hate Professor Hulk, he's just not that fun.  Okay so those are my criticisms, what did I like about the movie?  I guess everything else?  The time travel plot let's us revisit and honor some old moments in Marvel with a new lens in sort of a Back to the Future Part 2 way that's a lot of fun, and it brings back some characters I didn't think we'd ever see again.  The movie has a big emotional core, and a climactic end that is godamn powerful.  This movie juggles a lot.  Seriously this is like watching someone juggle 10 flaming chainsaws, it's a godamn miracle it works at all.  That it works this well is even more of a miracle.  It's an imperfect movie, but perfectly satisfying conclusion to this arc of the Marvel saga.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"As a subversion of the Superman mythos, Brightburn doesn't quite work.  It has a lot of opportunities, but it all happens too abruptly and it goes more for gritty fun than it does for any interesting insight.  As a slasher movie where the villain has powers though, it's really quite a bit of fun.  Not perfect, not by a long shot, but still quite a bit of fun.  I actually really like the idea of the mother not being able to accept her child's turn, that felt really genuine and almost true to how I imagine parents of real killers must feel.  When people are approaching him in scenes not knowing he has powers too, there is a tension to knowing something they don't know.  Then when we do get to the superpowered killing, it is gritty and over-the-top in it's brutality in a grim and satisfying way.  Not to mention, without going into spoilers, the movie ended in a way I really didn't expect.  It's not a great movie, it really didn't achieve the potential it could have grabbed at, but it's still a good time for a horror film that's a bit different.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"The funny thing with Shamaz is it almost feels like half of it is an indie film about an orphan boy finding a family and the other half is this wacky superhero movie.  The other funny this is, it kind of works!  Kind of.  Both parts I actually really like.  I didn't think I'd like all the other orphan kids, his new family, but I really enjoyed their stories.  The superhero comedy stuff all works too.  Zachary Levi is absolutely fantastic as an adult superhero with a child's mind, and he's just damn funny.  The villain is a bit standard, but still enjoyable enough, and the movie is just a great time.  Where it doesn't quite work for me, and really my only nitpick, is the blending of the two elements.  I don't quite buy Shazam and Billy Batson as the same character.  Billy is this brooding sad character, and Shazam is fun and wacky.  I guess it's supposed to be something like with Spider-Man where when he's in the suit, he lets loose and feels more free to get all his quips going, but with Spider-Man that works better because the character is still played by Tom Holland.  With this, it's two different actors, and it really does feel like two different characters.  Yeah Zachary Levi feels like a kid, but just not this kid.  Other than that though, Shazam really is a ton of fun.\",\n",

It does capture the sensation of being lost in a field and losing your sense of direction very well, even with its supernatural edge added on to it.  That's really the best part of it.  I also liked how the characters are actual characters, with actually a pretty good amount of development and decent intelligence to them.  The things I thought they should do, they do.  Where the movie started to lose me a bit is near the third act where it just goes full Stephen King and gets a bit too weird.  Don't get me wrong, I love weirdass Stephen King, and I was with it for a lot of the supernatural stuff in here, but at a certain point it kinda goes off the deep end and becomes a bit tough to swallow.  Even so, I liked the movie.  It was creepy, I didn't always know where it was going, and it tapped into a very real personal fear.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"As a sophomore horror effort, Us is pretty godamn good.  It doesn't follow a lot of the standard horror tropes, it's something a little unexpected, and it tries to say something.  For that, even when it's unsuccessful, I do give it a lot of props.  I do have to acknowledge a couple things that do sort of hold it back.  For one, the pacing is a little off.  The first half hour for one is honestly pretty boring.  I get that it's establishing mood and character, but it just drags and it's really a waiting game to get to the main event that we know is coming.  Even when the big moment does come, the movie really does seem to stroll along in telling its story.  This is fine in principle, and even admirable, but it just doesn't quite work as well as it could.  A bigger issue for me though is in some plot holes.  An interesting thing I've found with Jordan Peele's brand of horror is he really is interested in telling you how things work, and why the weird horrific stuff is happening, and for the most part he actually gives good explanations.  However, in Us, there's a couple points where the more we know the more it starts to kind of fall apart.  In particular there is a late movie twist that, for me anyway, seemed to betray a lot of the character motivations that happened up until that point.  I tried to justify it in my head, and maybe watching it again will make it work, but for now it really bothered me.\\nI mention these problems because otherwise, Us really does work.  The interesting thing is that while it never really scared me, there is a genuine sense of dread that holds throughout the whole movie.  There are no false scares or jump scares, the horror is very matter-of-fact, and it unravels slowly.  It takes you a while to really realize what type of movie it actually is but once you do, you're deep in the thick of it.  I also really have to talk about the acting, especially from Lupita Nyong'o.  She's one of those actors I always knew was good but never really saw a movie that showcased just how good she was.  This was that movie.  But all the actors are great, and most have to play two very different characters, often sharing a screen with their alternate selves, and they consistently nail it.\\nUs didn't quite work for me as well as Get Out did.  It's not a movie I can see myself returning to and enjoying as much as I can Get Out, and its problems are much more transparent.  But in a way, I feel like Jordan Peele has already established himself as such a great director of horror that he's instantly held himself to a higher standard.  Us is good, it's original, and it's got some great acting, but I just hope his next is a little more solid.\\n\",\n",

       "    'comment': 'Well, the original was better.  It\\'s fine, and ultimately impressive.  Really, there is a lot to admire about the movie, but still it can\\'t escape the shadow of the original.  The weird thing is despite being longer a lot of times it feels like it\\'s rushing through the beats of the original.  Most notably, Mufasa\\'s death scene (spoiler\\'s I guess) feels weirdly rushed.  I remember in the original there was time dwelling on Simba looking at the body and begging for Mufasa to get up.  Here, he just kinda looks at it, sniffles a bit, and the scene moves on.  Look I\\'m not saying it needs to be a shot for shot remake, but if you are going to go through the effort of doing the exact same scenes, either do them better, or do them at least as good, don\\'t just rush through them to check off a box.  That\\'s this films biggest flaw, and it really did bother me.  It lives under the shadow of the original often doing things because \"the original did it\" without really seeming to have an understanding of why that worked in the original.  It was different artists with different visions.  However, when it\\'s doing it\\'s own thing, it actually kinda\\' works.  A lots been made of Timon and Pumbaa in this movie, and rightfully so, they\\'re one of the few things that is expanded and made to live on their own.  They\\'re essentially the same sort of characters, but Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen bring their own personality to them.  They were allowed to improvise and give their own spin with new lines and humor.  They even have a new philosophy and debate on Hakuna Matata versus Circle of Life that\\'s actually genuinely interesting.  I also liked how their home is inhabited by other animals and it shows how Simba became part of that community in his exile.  It\\'s expansions like this where the film does its own thing where it really shines.  Yes the visuals are nice, but the animals don\\'t show the personality like they did in the animation because Lions can\\'t cry/smile/laugh in real life so what were left with is a really pretty Disney Nature CGI-fest.  It\\'s these narrative moments that make the film work.  I ultimately give it a moderately positive review because…damnit it\\'s still The Lion King, and yeah there were enough things it did right.  But at the end of the day, if I ever want to see The Lion King again, I\\'m going to watch the original.',\n",

I mean yeah it\\'s still riddled with product placement and an egregious amount of Disney marketing, but it\\'s still charming and funny enough that it kinda\\' works.  While we\\'ve seen other movies and TV shows tackle this \"internet as a city\" concept before, seeing it with Disney talent is actually pretty cool.  I liked eBay as a store, I liked pop up ads as annoying guys on the street, hell as ridiculously filtered as it was I even kinda\\' liked how they showed the Dark Web!  Seriously, the Dark Web in a Disney movie!  I mean they Nerfed the hell out of it but still, pretty crazy.  However I do miss the video game elements that were such a big part of the original film, that really feel missing here.  One of my favorite parts of this film is the online game Slaughter Race, and it\\'s really cool to see how they handle online gaming, and handle a game that\\'s basically Twisted Metal through a Disney filter which is pretty fun.  However, it\\'s just one game.  I also found the handling of Ralph\\'s character really clumsy here.  He made mistakes in the first movie, but he had a good heart.  Here, he makes some choices that make it really hard to root for him.  Yeah he learns his lesson, but it makes his development in the original feel forgotten and he comes off really selfish.  In the end it\\'s a flawed but still really fun movie.',\n",

It's not great, but it's Godzilla, and it's fun.  They go much bigger with the number of fan monsters, and I enjoyed that, and even throw in some new ones.  There isn't anything cinematically notable like there was in the last American film this time around though.  That one had such a sense of scale to it, and this one it's really just a monster movie.  But as far as monster movies go, it's a pretty good one.  I wish there was more light during the monster fights, and for that matter I just wish there were more monster fights (despite what people are saying I don't think this is the non-stop monster brawl that's been advertised), but for what we got I enjoyed it.

       "    'comment': \"The first Happy Death Day was a refreshing new take on the slasher genre with an enjoyable lead actress and a fun dark humor.  Not perfect, but fun, and I was actually looking forward to the sequel.  What I can give this sequel is it's not a rehash, well, not in the traditional sense.  While it does tread over familiar scenes, it does so with the time travel mechanic in sort of a Back to the Future 2 way that's actually quite fun.  The plot itself, is brand new.  However, it pretty much drops the slasher element for this weird overexplained sci-fi story that we didn't really need and a convoluted plot that even it can't seem to keep track of.  I'm not even joking, besides kicking Tree back into the loop, the entirety of the first 20 minutes are completely inconsequential to the rest of the movie.  There's even a few weird twists in the first act that seems to be completely forgotten about by end.  The movie is ultimately kinda' forgettable.  Literally, it's been a couple days since I saw it and honestly I can't even remember who the killer (killers?) actually ended up being this time around.  Jessica Rothe as Tree is still a standout performance in this, managing to be really funny and actually pulling off some heartfelt moments too.  It's passably entertaining, worth watching once if you liked the first, but it's nothing special.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"Maybe my expectations were too high, hell I even loved The LEGO Ninjago Movie, the one in this franchise most people seem to agree is pretty mediocre.  But this one just didn't do it for me as much.  Is LEGO Movie 2 bad?  No, not by a long shot.  I still give a positive ranking, but only marginally, and I'm a bit harsher on it than usual just because of the precedent this franchise has set and just how far the ball has been dropped here.  If this was where the franchise had started, I'd say it was better than expected for LEGO, but still not great if I'm being totally honest.  It falls into a lot of that sequel fatigue of the same, but not as good.  They explore different worlds, but only a couple, and they aren't as crazy or interesting as the first one.  There's more about the connection between the Lego world and the human world, but after the mindf*** ending of the first this time it just doesn't feel as organic.  Yeah there's a nice bit about sibling relationships, but overall the human element just comes out a little weird this time around and raises some bizarre questions.  The biggest downer though is the comedy, in that it's just not as funny.  The first Lego movie was outright hilarious.  This one, at best, is chuckle-worthy.  There were 2 or 3 decent laughs, but for the most part it just got small smiles out of me.  Having said that, it's still charming and the animation is still absolutely gorgeous.  The characters are all likeable, new and old, and kids will definitely love it.  It's a shame that it's such a massive step down from the first one, but with the bar set so high even a step down is still a decent movie.\",\n",

       "    'comment': 'So when I heard Sony was doing an animated Spider-Man, good lord this is about a million miles from where I thought they would be.  By that I mean good, like, really good.  Like, maybe the best Spider-Man movie ever good?  Is that even possible?  It\\'s weird because it even does things that were terrible mistakes in other movies and does them here in a way that works out with artistic brilliance.  For example, when Ang Lee did stylized comic panels in Hulk, it was confusing and weird.  When this movie does it, it adds to the energy and atmosphere of the film without ever interrupting the flow of the action.  How?  How did they do that?  Maybe because this whole movie is basically a comic book.  The characters look more like comic books than ever, and even the different Spider-Men have different art styles to them, and did I mention the \"bing\" and \"pow\" and \"bagel\" text sound effects and even thought bubbles that will appear over their heads?  This movie just oozes so much style.  And we get so many cool Spider-Men, and so many cool villains, and somehow it never feels crowded like it did in Spider-Man 3 or X3.  Again, mistakes in the past but here it works.  What the hell!  And it does all of this without missing it\\'s emotional core.  Actually my favorite moment in the movie isn\\'t a big action sequence, it\\'s a small moment of all the Spider-Men sharing their experiences of loss, and experience they can all only share with each other.  It\\'s surprisingly powerful considering one of the characters involved is a talking pig.  Really if I had a critique, it would be wanting a few more moments like this.  Also probably more of other Spider-Men, because really this story is Miles, Peter, and Gwen\\'s story and the other three are more or less background.  I would have liked it to be more even, but that might have pushed the magic formula.  Honestly I shouldn\\'t be complaining because that this works at all is amazing  That it\\'s this damn good is a godamn miracle.',\n",

The funny thing is noticing as an adult there are some elements that could be questionable, namely that the directing and music can be a bit basic and pedestrian, and there is an overall feeling of camp to a lot of it.  I also never noticed before that the actual plot of the villain is a bit convoluted.  But the thing is, none of that matters.  In fact, it's almost part of the charm.  The comedy works, the adventure works, the sense of fun just works.  The camp is part of the charm, and all you need to know about the story is beat the bad guy and true love conquers all.  It's a great introduction to adventure stories for kids with just a bit of edginess, and watching it years later it's just a damn entertaining movie.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"Objectively speaking, this not a good movie.  Even so, I have to admit I kind of liked it.  Look, the story is as bare bones as it gets, basically just being a corny little haunted house story with some super forced and contrived backstories to either give a false sense of depth or provide fodder for scares.  But if a movie's atmosphere and look is strong enough, I can kind of get past a lot of that, and The Nun just nailed a lot of the atmosphere of stuff I like.  I like religious horror (except the overused exorcism trope), I like people walking around old castles, I like foggy graveyards, and the idea of a haunted abbey with a creepy nun just really appeals to a particular sense in me.  As far as creepy Hammer Horror atmosphere, The Nun has it in spades, and it totally grabbed the part of me that wanted to see a priest running through an overly foggy graveyard.  However, I know that is a particular appeal, and as far as plot and scares go The Nun doesn't really work.  It's got creepy atmosphere that's actually pretty effective, but as far as actual scares it's just cheap jump scares.  The characters are all surprisingly good and well played, but they don't have much story to work with.  So I guess it's more of a guilty pleasure than a quality movie.\",\n",

Yeah there are some moments where the boys have some very real conversations, but these feel genuine to them.  At it's core it's just a blunt and raw look at a people and a time, that being young skaters in the mid-90s, and honestly it kind of nails it.  It's not always pleasant, in fact it's often painfully uncomfortable, but that's genuine to the experience.  I guess it's a coming of age story, but I'm not even really sure if the character really comes of age by the end.  Landmark moments that would have been romanticized in other films are shown unfiltered here.  These people existed, and to a degree these people still do exist.  It's not always pleasant, but it's raw and kind of beautiful.\",\n",

When I saw the trailers, I just thought \"oh great, more Garfield/Alvin and The Chipmunks bull****\".  Everything about it\\'s CGI live-action family film hybrid screamed \"we\\'ve done this before, and it was garbage\" to me.  It was only after years of insistence that no, this time it\\'s good, that I actually got around to seeing it and...yeah...it is, it really is.  It doesn\\'t reinvent the wheel or anything, at it\\'s core this is still a fairly standard family film about finding a place to belong, and I really didn\\'t care for the central conflict or the villain.  But nothing about it is inherently bad, at worst it\\'s just standard in a movie that is otherwise really good.  Literally from the first minute of screen-time as I was settling in I had already started laughing.  The movie is just unbearably (no pun intended) funny, and it manages to be funny in a way that is clean and clever.  It uses wit and charm to convey it\\'s humor and it works.  When it\\'s not funny, it\\'s still extremely charming and just damn likable.  Yeah it\\'s a pretty basic story, but damnit all the story works.  Sure, I don\\'t think we really needed this villain, but as far as the story of Paddington finding a family and a home goes it\\'s genuinely heartwarming.

       "    'comment': \"Starting as a moody sci-fi and taking turns into horror and ending in a realm akin to 2001: A Space Odyssey, Annihilation is a weird journey.  Did I like it?  For the most part, yes.  There's some weird pacing choices, sometimes for the better making you feel as disjointed as the characters and not knowing what to expect, but other times there are moments that seem to drag in weird ways or weird bits of explanation.  To the latter, we know from the get-go that Natalie Portman is the only survivor of the expedition through a narrative through line of her telling this story to scientists, which does dissolve some of the tension.  It's weird choices like that which I can't ignore and keep this movie from perfection.  But on the other hand, god damn is it beautiful and spooky and horrifying and wonderful and just so much.  One moment it'll be disturbing and awful, the next it will be amazing and dreamlike, and that's kind of the point.  There is an amazing dreamlike quality captured both in the visuals and the narrative that really is amazing.  I really can't deny I was genuinely intrigued the whole way through, and there were some scenes (especially one with a bear) that I was completely gripped by.  It's wildly original, and damn it all it takes risks and we need that in our sci-fi.  It's an imperfect, but wildly original sci-fi film that still deserves attention.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"I expected this to be a fairly straightforward docudrama on the life of van Gogh, but to my surprise it was a far more artistic and ethereal experience.  For better and for worse.  For the most part, this really works, and I really liked this approach to getting inside the mind of the troubled artist.  Van Gogh in the film often talks about how he thinks the world is broken and he might be the only one who sees it right, so we see a very specific vision of the world from him and it creates a unique vision in the film that gives a unique style.  However, there's times where this style goes a bit too far and gets a bit pretentious.  Extended periods of weird audio loops of dialogue, or excessive shaky cam during quieter moments.  I got what the intended effect was, but it was overkill and obnoxious.  In general though, the vision works, and gives something more unique than a standard docudrama.  I liked this unique look at a troubled artist.  I also really liked seeing him have conversations with his peers about other artists and about his place in the art world as a new voice that seemed to mirror what modern artists of different forms say, but in a way that felt genuine and not hoky.  It's a moody and unique film with a distinct vision.  Not to mention Willem Dafoe gives it his all, when he puts on the overalls and the hat and walks through a field of flowers, he IS van Gogh.  Sometimes the film is a bit much, but at least it's something.  I liked it, more than I expected actually.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"I'm going to be honest here, this is one of the Coen's lesser films in my opinion.  The biggest reason for that being it somehow stimultaniously feels overstuffed with too much while also being kind of dull.  There's times when it races, and times when it sort of just drags.  It seems to be searching for a type of comedy that the Coens would later perfect in movies like Burn After Reading, but this is definitely the beta version of that.  I feel like with another script rewrite, and some tightening of the editing and cutting the time down, it could be a great film.  As is though, it's still a Coen film, and they don't really make bad films.  I still really liked what the film was doing.  As sort of a tribute to old school screwball Hollywood the movie is fun.  The fast-paced dialogue that you really have to pay attention to and quick blink-and-you'll-miss-it visual gags are often brilliant, and the movie is just damn gorgeous in it's expressionist visualization of New York.  It's story is silly, and frankly kind of stupid, but I think it's supposed to be, and for what it is it works.  It is a little long and a little clumsy, but it's a fun movie.  Not their best, but it's hard not to be charmed by it.\",\n",

Essentially it's a road movie, and I like road movies, and it has a distinct sense of humor that borders on surreal while never breaking completely into fantasy.  It's shockingly funny too.  Not just the Ferns segments, which maintain the web series' style, but the surrounding road segments as well.  Will Ferrell as a coked up executive version of himself was especially great.  It keeps to Ferns humor and it's hilarious.\",\n",

       "    'comment': 'A movie I\\'ve had to sit on for several days and I think I\\'ll have to sit on even longer.  Controversial, dangerous, these are words thrown around a lot with this movie.  I guess I see why, but maybe not for the right reason.  It\\'s asking questions, but a lot of people are getting the wrong thing out of those questions.  Are they questions that have been asked before?  Have they been asked in a similar way?  Sure, but maybe not in this climate and certainly not with this character, and that\\'s what makes it different. Without going too deep into my own theories, the biggest thing I got out of it is \"help people\".  There were so many points where this slow-motion car crash could have been stopped, but it didn\\'t.  Another thing is, how much are other people to blame?  These are interesting questions, and what makes it more interesting is knowing this character and where he ends up.  As to the violence, none of the violence is particularly over the top in a Deadpool or Michael Bay sort of way, but that\\'s sort of what makes it more uncomfortable.  It\\'s grounded and unnerving.  It\\'s also very Joker-ish, with some scenes that are weirdly playful in a bizarre way where you don\\'t really know what he\\'s going to do.  This was a unique direction to take this character, and Joaquin Phoenix kills it as Arthur/Joker with a empathic psychopath.  It\\'s a thoughtful but uncomfortable feel-bad sort of movie I\\'m still thinking about and really want to talk about.  I don\\'t get that sort of movie often enough.',\n",

Joe 3.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, just be prepared, it's ridiculous, on par with the level of insanity we see in most superhero movies these days.  The problems that arise there is there are some prolonged sequences that are so riddled with CGI is basically watching a cartoon or a video game cutscene.  Now, I like cartoons, hell I even like some video game cutscenes, but with those there's a consistency in knowing what you're getting compared to the rest of the product.  Here, the movie's really at it's best when the effects stay real and even a little more grounded.  They can still be ridiculous over-the-top fun, but once it becomes a cartoon it started to lose me.  That being said, the action in this is still a helluva lot of fun, and Idris Elba makes good villain.  The final sequence of old tech vs new tech is genuinely great, and unlike anything I've see in one of these Fast movies before.  And yeah, the dynamic of Hobbs and Shaw is a lot of fun, playing off the toxic alpha personalities the two of them both possess.  It's not the best of the F&F films, but it's a solid entry in ridiculousness.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"Pretty much a perfect saga here.  My only real issues with Toy Story 4 are that it could have been funnier, a lot of the other characters are sidelined for Woody and Bo's story, and how it's ultimately kind of unnecessary.  But even these issues I can kind of justify.  It's more about the emotions than the comedy, the story really is Woody's story, and despite being unnecessary it does take the Toy Story story into a new direction.  It visits a lot of familiar territory, but does so in some new ways.  The villain for example does not have your standard Toy Story villain ending, and without diving too deep into spoilers it's kind of a tearjerker.  And yes the whole thing is a tearjerker.  The return of Bo Peep I found an interesting choice, but she wasn't the most dynamic character in the first two films.  Here, they expand on her a lot while still keeping the essence of her character, and she becomes on of the most interesting characters in this whole franchise through her arc.  And yeah that ending, it broke me, honestly I was holding it together fine but there is a line from Buzz that comes at the end that if you're not crying yet, you will.  Toy Story 4 doesn't quite feel as polished as some other Pixar films, but it's still an incredibly solid film with characters we love and some new ones that are a lot of fun.  I haven't even talked about Forky, he's a spectacular new entry.  It's not a part of the story I wanted, but now that it's here I'm glad I got it.  It's got all the heart and beauty and enough of the comedy to be a worthy entry in this franchise.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"A film with a fun high concept but it's focus in the wrong place, Yesterday is charming enough, but ultimately disappointing.  It's not a bad movie per se, but it's just not a very good movie.  The idea presents a lot of fun concepts.  One direction you could go is full fantasy and explore how this parallel world came to be, but the film ultimately ignores that entirely despite giving weird hints here and there that seem to go nowhere.  You could go into what this means for the explosion of fame, the ideas of how the music industry has changed from when The Beatles exploded to now, and at the films best moments it does this and it can be interesting.  In the end what the movie is really interested in doing is using this really fun concept to tell another boring love story.  Lilly James is charming as all hell, but she's playing a character that just isn't interesting and her motivations are either boring tropes or borderline appalling.  The first half of the movie I was kind of into it, but when it became clear any intrigue into the world of fame was going to be sidelined for blind praising of The Beatles and a boring love story, the movie lost me.  I didn't hate it.  It still has a certain charm to it, but ultimately it's just a lot of missed potential.\",\n",

       "    'comment': 'An apparently controversial ending to the Skywalker saga, I\\'m curious how this film will age.  Afterall, we forget but Return of the Jedi was not well liked when it first came out.  In any case, what did I think?  Honestly, I really liked it.  Yes, I\\'ve heard the criticism about the cleanup of The Last Jedi and the fetch quest stuff and \"that\" kiss and while I do agree that these are problems, they never ruined the movie for me.  Honestly some of the things that ruined the movie for other people I kinda\\' liked.  The idea that the Emperor has been in the shadows and has even created some of the villains of the previous movies I actually really dug.  Partly just because it\\'s great to see Ian McDiarmid back on screen, but also having an overarching villain for all 9 movies I kinda\\' like.  I like the banter of the characters.  Some people say they argue, but honestly I think this is just how friends talk in tense situations and having been with friends in tense situations it felt familiar.  And then there\\'s the action, holy crap, this is some of the best Star Wars action I\\'ve ever seen.  During the final confrontation there was honestly a point where I was whispering to myself \"go, go!\" for a character to get to a place, and even though I knew from a narrative standpoint of course they would get there, I still felt uncertain.  I was never bored by the movie, in its action or in its character moments.  The character turns we get feel strong and natural, and at times even moving.  In the end it\\'s not a perfect end because I don\\'t think this whole thing was mapped out as well as it could have been.  But as it is, honestly, I actually loved it.',\n",

       "    'comment': 'Similar to what Rian Johnson did for Brick he\\'s now doing for the whodunit genre.  Knives Out is really a classic story of it\\'s kind set in modern day with Daniel Craig even playing a very clear Hercule Poirot type character.  There\\'s a bit more humor and self-awareness than a lot of those classic stories, but never to the degree that it takes away from the twists and the mysteries.  And there are some good twists.  In fact one of the biggest mysteries is revealed midway through the movie which actually led me to check the time thinking \"damn, are we near the end already?\" but nope, they were just taking the movie on a left turn to Albuquerque that I did not anticipate and changed the course of the whole thing.  Johnson has constructed a great mystery in the spirit of the classics.  The fun of it too is how many twists there are without it ever feeling overdone.  In that way also you can predict a few twists, but not another, so have fun feeling smart and still feel surprised by the others.  It\\'s just a classic fun film of its type.',\n",

Telling a bit of an origin story to the mythos of Santa Claus through the eyes of a mailman, it\\'s a movie that\\'s at times very funny but usually just incredible charming.  If it has a choice between a charming character moment or a big laugh, it\\'ll go for the charm, and that\\'s okay.  It makes a very sweet movie that never feels saccharine, but just right.  Oh and did I mention it\\'s beautiful?  Because holy crap this animation is gorgeous.  If I had a complaint it\\'d be that there\\'s a couple pop song moments that don\\'t quite fit in which almost feels inescapable in an animated film these days, but the biggest thing is that in the third act we get one of those \"liar revealed\" tropes.  It\\'s an annoying trope and I hate it, but fortunately it doesn\\'t last very long and admittedly it does propel the film towards its final message which is a good one.  Other than that, I think we could have a Christmas classic on our hands here.',\n",

It's not an abrupt turn exactly either like From Dusk Till Dawn, it's a bit more gradual, but by the end it's clear the turn has happened.

If you're anticipating something on the level of Krampus or other American Christmas horror entries, it's not really that.  It is definitely a darker take on Christmas, but it does so with a much cheekier edge.  It's a slow-burn movie, more character driven, and based on ideas and storytelling moreso than outlandish imagery and effects.  That said, there's some pretty insane stuff near the end, but a lot of this movie is the characters learning the legend and figuring out what's going on for themselves.  For that, it still works for me.  I enjoyed the characters, and even though I knew what they were going to discover how they discovered it was still fun to watch.  It's a weird little film.\",\n",

Honestly, even by Michael Bay standards, it's kinda…good?  Don't get me wrong, it's over the top and ridiculous as all hell, but unlike the worst of Michael Bay there is a great deal that remains practical, they actually keep it at a reasonable runtime (2 hours rather than 3!), and they mix up the action so you never get bored of one type of thing happening.  It almost feels like Michael Bay used all he learned from those s***y transformer sequels to actually make a good movie here.  Unfortunately, the story is where he hasn't learned much.  The basic premise we get is fine.  Despite being both outlandish and bare-bones, I still want to see them succeed.  The problem is in how it's told.  Oftentimes it will jump around in how the team got together and with Bay's cocaine-fueled directing style this out-of-order narrative becomes a little disorienting.  It also tries to have something of a bigger message about our current state of the world and dictators.  Not a bad idea per se, I'm just not sure this is the movie to do it in.  Still, it's a fun movie.  It's surprisingly restrained in all the bad things about Bay but goes full force in the fun stuff.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"A film about friendship and forgiveness more than a film about Mr. Rogers, it's told through the lens of a friendship with Mr. Rogers.  That's really the best way you could do this type of story though I think.  Tom Hanks is such a powerhouse icon himself it might be hard to see Rogers through him, but he's so damn good that pretty quickly you just fall into it.  The growing friendship is genuine and intriguing as hell.  Honestly the best part of the movie is scenes of these two clashing personalities just talking to each other.  It's so simple, just a room and two opposing types chatting, and it's riveting as all hell.  Seeing Rogers break down his barriers to the human inside is heartwarming and real.  It's just a sweet movie, and a fascinating look at what this legend would have been like when the cameras weren't rolling.  The answer, it turns out, is not all that different.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"While it's miles ahead of the Jim Carrey one purely on charm and appearance alone, it's still not a great movie.  It's still a little conflicted in following the source material and making up its own stuff, and it does sometimes go too far into modern pop culture sense.  Compared to previous Illumination entry The Lorax though and especially compared to the Carrey film, it's surprisingly charming and even makes some attempt at being timeless and faithful to the classic.  Is it entirely successful?  No, but I appreciate the attempt.  I also appreciate the new focus, where we only see a hint of the Grinch's origins with the focus much more on his stealing Christmas, and the origins we do get were much sadder for me and didn't betray the character of the Whos the way the Carrey film did.  There's still a lot of dumb stuff though, like a punk skater Cindy-Lou, and forced message with her mom that just didn't work for me.  But in terms of visuals and just Christmas spirit the movie has it.  It looks great, and just feels like Christmas.  It's not great, but I liked it.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"The biggest issue this movie has is with its villain.  I guess I won't spoil it, but really if you've read the comics, played the games, or just googled any of the character names of people in this movie you know who it is and yet they treat it like this big reveal.  The first movie had something of a villain reveal too, but they handled it in such a way that it really worked.  Here, it just doesn't.  On top of that, his motives and overall goals are a little difficult to follow.  Regardless, it's still a helluva fun ride.  His missions were some of the ones I enjoyed the most in the Spider-Man games, and it allows for some truly mind-bending trippy visuals later in the film.  That's where the film shines the highest, in its warped inception-ey trip-out sequences.  Also, in it's character moments with the heroes.  Tom Holland is still the best Spider-Man, and damnit all Zendaya is really winning me over.  Those two are just really cute, and their developing relationship is charming as hell.  That relationship and seeing Spidey try to fill Tony's shoes (spoilers) is great stuff.  It's another solid, if not perfect, Spider-Man film.\",\n",

Adapting stories like Harold or Jangly Man, they don\\'t follow the originals exactly, but capture their spirit and have some genuinely creepy moments.  However, then there\\'s the stuff in between with the teenagers solving the mystery of the book and that stuff gets really hokey.  The lead girl\\'s acting also sways back and forth wildly.  Sometimes she\\'s genuinely incredible, other times she\\'s soap opera melodramatic.  Then of course we have our studio mandated \"maybe things aren\\'t so bad\" ending that puts a bow on top.  So yeah, it\\'s a mixed bag.  But as everyone else has said, it\\'s good gateway horror.  There are some genuinely creepy scenes that have a ton of creativity behind how they pull of their scares that I really wish more horror would attempt.  But then you have you\\'re Nancy Drew time-is-running out mystery they cut back to.  I\\'m conflicted on this one.  However, the stuff that\\'s good is just too good to miss for fans of the book series.',\n",

Detective Pikachu himself is especially likable, particularly from Ryan Reynolds immense charm.  It's also just a fun movie with a fun world.  It took forever for us to see the Pokémon world in live action, but now that we do, it looks great, and there's some real solid action sequences here.

It strangely doesn't feel regressive and outdated, it feels charmingly retro, like we're revisiting these characters we loved and just seeing what they're up to 10 years later, and this feels like the natural progression of their story.  Sure, I want movies that take bold risks in new directions, but other times I just want to see a bunch of likable characters kill zombies in slow motion and that's what we get here.  We see new types of zombies which is pretty cool, we see some new locations, but at the end of the day it's just a fun movie.  It doesn't try to be anything more than what it is, it's just fun!  I had fun watching it!  I like these characters, I like this world, I like the kinetic energy of this direction.  10 years from now, I'll take another.\",\n",

I have the same problems with it as I did with its predecessor, that being that the grotesque pleasure it takes in human cruelty becomes hard to tolerate at times.  However, at other times there is a genuine creativity in its cruelty and even an art to it's horror.  Its final moments are almost beautiful.  The fact that it shows these psychopaths in their murderous moments as inhuman monsters giving terrifying monologues but also just shooting the shit and eating ice cream is kind of intriguing.  It's brilliant and also horrifying, which I guess is the point, even if it is hard to tolerate at times.  It's good, even when it's hard to stomach.\",\n",

       "    'comment': \"At it's best it's a brutally entertaining thrill ride homage to classic horror films of the 70s.  At it's worst it's a sickening exercise in depravity and the relishing of human suffering.  Which side of the spectrum you most find it will really depend on your tolerance level.  I guess I'm somewhere in the middle.  I love the gritty gross feel akin to Texas Chainsaw and similar films, but the sheer brutality and pornographic enjoyment of torture got to be frankly uncomfortable at times.  At other times though, it's a godamn blast.  While it's controversial, I actually love the final act.  Supposedly this all started as a pitch for a haunted house attraction, and I can see that.  It's a bit much, but the bat*** insane Resident Evil style shenanigans are just fun for me.  It's a mixed bag, some of it's really unpleasant, but a lot of it I really like.\",\n",

       "    'comment': 'I really love the horror movie at a haunted house attraction premise, and there aren\\'t enough movies that take advantage of that idea.  More-and-more are, but it\\'s such a ripe idea for ideas I\\'d really love to see even more.  Interestingly this one is more about the build up to the night of, but it still works, perhaps even better.  The horror is actually very subtle, and builds on a type of horror and unease that personal freaks the s***t  out of me.  That being, that feeling of \"wait, did that things just move?\" or \"was that there before?\".  There tons of those moments in this movie.  The moments where someone looks away for a second, and looks back and something has changed just slightly, but noticeably enough; or where they turn on the camera and something new is in the room and you the viewer notice it before they do.  Stuff that creeps me out more than any jump scare or any creep with a knife, something about it feels more genuine.  It taps into that real world feeling of \"wait, did I lock the door? Or did someone open it?\"\\nOn top of that, it\\'s just a masterfully crafted movie.  The characters are actually pretty likable for the most part.  Yeah you do kinda\\' get that feeling of \"leave you idiots!\", but they do address it enough to move past it.  Their relationships feel real, and their acting feels human.  Even the documentary structure of the editing gets explained in an acceptable way.  It\\'s a genuinely great found footage movie.  If you don\\'t like the genre, it probably won\\'t sway you, but if you do it\\'s one of the best I\\'ve seen.',\n",
