# APIs
## OKTA

This application uses Okta for user identification/authentication instead of Spring Security with the back end application. Login is handled on the front end with Okta. Okta authenticates the user by username and password and returns a JWT access token to the front end application. All requests to the back end application must contain this bearer access token in the authorization header. Spring security authenticates the user with Okta and assigns user authorization roles. 

# Installation Instructions

To run the app locally, fork or clone the repo, obtain OKTA login passwords and add locally through a .env file in the root directory. 
Run npm -i to install packages.

## Other Scripts

    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
