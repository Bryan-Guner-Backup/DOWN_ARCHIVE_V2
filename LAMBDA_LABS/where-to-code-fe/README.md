## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/uHo1KeRc/labspt7-where-to-code)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Labs-PT7-Student-Guide-1a061b7dce394b7a9dc158f35a76d6c3)

HiveStack is a platform designed for avid WiFi users to be able to easily find hotspots that cater to their unique technical and environmental needs. A user will be able to search locations based on proximity to his/her geographical input, and the system will afford them a limited range of details about each location returned. They will be only able to see HiveStack locations without registering for a user account, and will also be limited to searching a limited range of environment variables.

Once a general user registers for an account, a sea of filtration options becomes available to them (a further incentive for registration). This will include the ability to filter locations by preset environmental preferences. They will also gain access to promotions, deals and coupons from preferred HiveStack Hubs (providers), as well as being granted immediate access to the WiFi password and downloading instructions per location prior to their arrival, which increases ease of use at the location. In addition to this, a user will be able to purchase special business deals from within the application.

### Future Expansions:

Providers will be able to post their location within the HiveStack network of businesses, which allows them to be featured to all general users whether or not they are logged in. This will be a motivating factor for paid registration, as Providers will not be able to register without paying for listing their business, as there will be a nominal cost associated with provider registration. Providers will also be able to offer unique coupons and discounts to the HiveStack users. They will be able to track the number of registered users. They will also be able to offer unique deals and coupons or discounts to registered users, and in turn collect payments from registered users for special deals that may be offered. Within the payment portal they will have access to a record of transactions, be able to track their received payments, and forward all proceeds to their listed bank account with implementation of the Stripe API.

### Key Features

- User Registration & Signup
- Google Maps Search Integration (Google Maps API)
- User Rating and Feedback System
- Saved and Recent Locations

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React , React Hooks & Redux

- React

  - Virtual DOM improves both the experience of the user and work of the developer — Virtual DOM helps to update any user’s changes without the other parts’ interference by applying isolated components. It greatly helps to smooth the experience of all participants in real time mode.
  - Saving time while re-using React components — React deals with isolated components, that’s why you can reuse them anytime you need. System upgrades will not impact or change your system.
  - The stable code is provided by one-direction data flow — Direct work with each component requires one-direction data flow and makes the code really stable. Another thing is that only downward data binding is possible in this JavaScript framework.
  - An open-source library with a variety of tools — All updates are released to the community. React has had the open-source library and engineers can introduce the additional tools.

- Redux

  Redux favors predictability and control over your component states, making it a great choice for building consistent, cross-environment, testable applications with React. It has middleware.

- React Hooks

  - Saving time while re-using React components and creating expandable custom React Components to extend React's functionality.

## Authentication API here

Our Authentication API uses `bcryptjs` to hash a user's password to be stored in our PostgreSQL database. Upon a successful login, the user will recieve a `jsonwebtoken` that give users access to registration based features. The JWT can be accessed on on the backed by using `res.locals.decodedToken` on protected routes, giving you access to `userId`, `username`, and `role`.

## Stripe API Integration

This has not been implented, and will be a future integration into this project on a possible later release canvas.
