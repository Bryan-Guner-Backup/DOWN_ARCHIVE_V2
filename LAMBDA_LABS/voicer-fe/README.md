## Project Overview

Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/bSVcWjZF/voicer

Notion documentation: https://www.notion.so/Voicer-3276d8fdf5df414299411e3e393167cd

## Mission
To create a voice over marketplace environment where users can post jobs, connect with reliable voice-over talent, offer a file delivery service between project owners and talent, and facilitate the financial transactions between the two parties.  


### Key Features

-    Users can create unique profiles that showcase their creative talent. 
-    Users can upload audio samples, and assign tags to individual audio samples to enhance searchability
-    Users can post jobs and "hire" individuals that have applied
-    Users can browse user profile snapshots, listening to audio samples in a Twitter-like format

## Tech Stack


### Front end built using:
The Voicer-App tech stack is as follows: 
- React for front-end framework 
- MaterialUI for styling/css
- @testing-library/react for unit testing
- Postgres for the database
- Heroku for backend deployment
- Netlify for frontend deployment
- AWS for asset storage (audio files)

#### React

React is a well supported, fully featured front end framework. We use Context for state management (instead of redux) since our global state schema is relatively simple (i.e.we think using redux for this application would be overkill). 

#### Node Sass

We started the project using Node Sass and Bootstrap, but will merge/migrate to MaterialUI in the near future. 

#### axios

-    We use axios for API calls. The framework is lightweight and simple, and meets all current needs of the project. 


#### Front end deployed to Netlify

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/voicer-be) built using: 

-    Postgres for database
-    Heroku for backend deployment
-    AWS for storage of audio samples


# APIs

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication API here

The authentication API is a gatekeeper function that is embedded in Provider.DataContext. We check if there's a token, and whether that token is still valid. While the token is valid, users remain logged in. When a user logs out or the token is deleted, the token is deleted. 

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Payment API here

There is currently no payments API for Voicer-App. 

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ B&W computer image loader API

We use an API for "random" image generation on the Jobs/Marketplace component (mostly to make advertised jobs a bit more visually appealing.) Documentation for the API can be found at: https://picsum.photos

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Testing

We use @testing-library/react for unit testing. This library had the advantage of working tightly with React and not needing additional setup. 

We expect a minimum threshold of 30% for test coverage. 

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Installation Instructions

To install the required directories for this project: 

1. Clone the master branch to your local device
2. CD into `/voicer-client`
3. From the terminal, run `npm i` or `yarn install`

## Other Scripts

    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
