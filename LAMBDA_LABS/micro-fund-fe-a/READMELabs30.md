# MicroFund Labs 30 

The Labs 30 engineering team was the second team to inherit the MicroFund Java Spring Application. The main purpose of this application is to connect Micro entrepreneurs with partner admins who can then accept applications for funding via the application. The main admin is the owner of the application who is providing the platform for the exchange of funding to take place.

## Configuration Instructions
Please check the package.json file. You will need to install any dependencies you need when you start up the app. Another requirement is the .env file with the correct environment variables. These should connect to OKTA for authentication purposes. 


## Operation and Installation Instructions

## Known Bugs

Problems with user roles: Unable to differentiate or create user roles, blocks ability for user flow and user interaction. Can not sign in as a microentrepreneur which makes you unable to apply to the program, which makes it impossible for a main admin to accept or reject application. Same for partner admins. An unknown issue with OKTA authentication process. Environment issues where some users may not be able to log into the backend of the application.


## Environment Setup

This app runs verification through OKTA, you will need to set up with the proper environment variables. This application runs properly on WebStorm and VSCode. 

## Deployment

To deploy this application you will need authenticated tokens from OKTA, login and a password that connects to Heroku. Please see OKTA docs for more info. [OKTA Docs] (https://docs.labs.lambdaschool.com/guides/okta/okta-basics)


## Troubleshooting 

When troubleshooting this application refer to OKTA docs first. All authentications and access goes through OKTA and the multi-user roles are buggy.
