            Firefly is designed for little hands with big ideas. Our innovative learning system is designed with
            children in mind. Our coding blocks are designed for 4-6 year-old children to easily move the blocks with
            their fingers!
          </p>
          <p class="hiw-text">
            Our blocks interact and connect in a highly visual and intuitive manner to create engaging educational
            interactions with the core concepts of coding. The coding blocks can connect in flexible patterns that
            encourage children to investigate and test their ideas! Watch them build what they imagine! We give wings to
            their ideas!

          features are key! My 10 year old only likes things he can tailor for himself. I don't want to gush but this is
          really interesting and exciting! I want to commend Firefly on 'creating worlds' and a really strong vision
          that really resonated with me. Amazing!"</p>

          user friendly for parents! I don't think I could survive without Firefly!"</p>
